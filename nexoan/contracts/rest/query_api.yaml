      summary: Get entities based on id or filter criteria
      description:
        This endpoint allows you to search for entities using either a specific `id` or a set of filter criteria. 

      requestBody:
        required: true
        description: |
          This request body corresponds to the filter criteria used to retrieve entities.

          - It is required to provide **either** `id` or `kind.major`. <br>
          - If `id` is provided, all other filter fields are ignored, and only the matching entity will be returned. <br>
          - If `id` is not provided, `kind.major` becomes required, and additional fields can be included as filters. <br>
          - All other attributes are optional.

      summary: Get relationships for an entity based off its id and/or other relationship filters
      description: |
        This endpoint retrieves the relationships of the specified entity, identified by its `entityId`.  
        You can optionally pass filter parameters in the request body to control which relationships are returned.

      parameters:
        - name: entityId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      requestBody:
        description: |
          The request body contains filter parameters used to filter the relationships of the entity identified by `entityId`.  
          This payload is optional - if omitted, the response will include all relationships associated with the given `entityId`.
          All fields in the payload are optional.

          - If the `id` of a relationship is provided in the payload, all other filter fields are ignored, and only the matching relationship will be returned.
          - If the `activeAt` field is provided, the response will include only relationships that were active at that specific timestamp - meaning they were created and not yet terminated at that time.
          - You may use either `activeAt` **or** `startTime`/`endTime` for filtering by time range, but not both.
          - The `direction` can be either **OUTGOING** or **INCOMING** corresponding to the direction of the relationship relative to the entity.
